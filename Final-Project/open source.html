		<div>
			Open source refers to the way in which materials are developed and distributed.
			<br /><br />
			Because of this, open source can technically be applied to pretty much
			everything. But the lable 'open source' is traditionally used in reference to
			the way in which computer software is produced/marketed.
			<br /><br />
			Regardless, the principle philosophy of open source is that anyone and everyone
			has access to the materials used to create the product, and can edit and modify
			them freely.
			<br /><br />
			Again, specifically applying this to software means that the source code and
			materials used to develope the application are freely avaliable to the public,
			and that users who modify code have no fear of legal repercussions.
			<br /><br />
			Just because it's <span class="i">freely</span> avalialbe, however, does not
			mean that it has to be <span class="i">completely</span> free.
			<br />
			<img src="images/question.jpg" alt="what is it?" style="float: right;"/>
			<br />
			Open source is <span class="u">only</span> concerned with the way in which the
			production materials are distributed. So developers are not forbidden from 
			charging a <span class="i">slight</span> fee.			
		</div>
		<br /><hr />
		<a name="why" style="font-weight: bold;">Why is it important?</a>
		<div>
			Open source is important because it allows everyone, including end users, to
			determine what software they use and how they use it.
			<br /><br />
			Open source also fundamentally makes sense.
			<br /><br />
			With proprietary software, companies include large licensing agreements that
			limit various activities users can do with/on the software. An example would
			be that Windows Vista will only allow the user to install the application
			7 times before their key expires.
			<br /><br />
			This means that if you were to have a <span class="u">very</span> bad year and
			ended up having to reinstall Windows Vista 7 times, you would have to go out 
			and purchase another copy before being able to install again.
			<br /><br />
			In another example, trying to read a Microsoft Office document on a computer
			without Microsoft Office would result in the loss of almost all of the document's
			formatting - not to mention 'special' features like tables and pictures. And if
			you try to install Microsoft Office on another computer, even if it's one
			<span class="i">you own</span>, you would have to purchase another copy of 
			Microsoft Office.
			<br /><br />
			Proprietary software also restricts knowledge by intentionally hiding the way
			it works from end users. Trying to 'decode' a closed source application can
			often result in a fine and an arrest - sometimes even jail time.
			<br /><br />
			A symptome of the mysterious nature of closed source software, proprietary
			software also often spies on the user. Sending back (sometimes) personal data
			back to the developer or to third party vendors.
			<br /><br />
			Open source alleviates all of these problems.
			<br /><br />
			When you buy and open source application, you own the application, not just a 
			license for a few uses.
			<br /><br />
			Open source software also eliminates the 'mystery' behind the way a program
			functions. And, in turn, eliminates the ability for developers and third party
			vendors to gather information without the users knowledge.
			<br /><br />
			Simply put, open source is 'Freedom of Software'.

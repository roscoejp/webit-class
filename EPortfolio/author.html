				<h1 style = "color: #979797; font-size: 1.5em;">I'M BORING</h1><br />
				My name is Roscoe Pyell, and I'm boring.<br /><br />
				I also don't take very good pictures... so for now, this is all you get.
				I suppose I'll have to put an actual picture up sometime, but for now I 
				think I can avoid it for just a little bit longer. In fact, you can think
				of this outfit as my haloween costume. Just think of me as a young
				Jonathan Goldsmith with a bag on his head...<br /><br />
				Aside from my aversion to photographs, I don't have very many interests
				outside of computers and the internet as a whole. Windsurfing and 
				snowboarding and skydiving are some of the things that come to mind, but
				those are only the stupid things I do in my freetime.<br /><br />
				I'd have to say that a majority of my time is spent on school work. Of
				course, living on campus helps.

				We once tried to ask Randy what he would do if he had to choose between
				landing in a tomato field or a road with power lines, and it took us
				nearly 20 mintues to get him to answer us. The rest of the time he
				just said that he wouldn't ever end up in that situation.
			</div>
			
			<div style="width: 350px; margin: 30px 10px 0 10px; float: right;">
				I don't really consider myself a very interesting invdividual. I mean, if
				you've bothered reading this far you <span style="font-style: italic;">
				have</span> to be bored by now right? If you aren't you have a tougher
				constitution that I thought you had.<br /><br />
				The guy in the picture there was my instructor. His name's Randy and
				he works at Skydive Miami and he has absolutely, positively no 
				imagination.

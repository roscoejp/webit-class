WebIT-Class
===========
Several websites that I created in college as part of my coursework.

- EPortfolio was used as a final project for my ENC1102: Composition II and as my second project in CIS3003: Fundamentals of Information Technology courses. The site uses XML as a sort of databasing mechanism thanks to the project requirements.

- Final-Project is a website about the concept of Open Source used as a final project for my CIS3003: Fundamentals of Information Technology class. There is a known issue where several pages render incorrectly when the screen size is smaller than 400px.

- Project1 is the first website I created for CIS3003: Fundamentals of Information Technology. While not the first ever website I've created, this was the first one that used CSS, Javascript, and HTML all at the same time. This was also the first time I'd ever written anything more than a basic webpage using <p> tags. The format derives from BBC's old site design.

- Splash was my second project for CIS3003: Fundamentals of Information Technology and was originally written using Flash and ActionScript. Later in the year, I rewrote the splash to use CSS animations and Javascript in order to reduce it's size and allow me to upload all of my projects to UCF's College of Engineering and Computer Science Sully server.
